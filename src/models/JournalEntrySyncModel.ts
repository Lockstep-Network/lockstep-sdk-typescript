/**
 * The JournalEntrySyncModel represents information coming into Lockstep from an external financial system or other
 * enterprise resource planning system.  To import data from an external system, convert your original data into
 * the JournalEntrySyncModel format and call the [Upload Sync File API](https://developer.lockstep.io/reference/post_api-v1-sync-zip).
 * This API retrieves all of the data you uploaded in a compressed ZIP file and imports it into the Lockstep
 * platform.
 *
 * Once imported, this record will be available in the Lockstep API as a JournalEntryModel
 *
 * For more information on writing your own connector, see [Connector Data](https://developer.lockstep.io/docs/connector-data).
